             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) · May 1, 2017</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">This project aims to create an improved model of a hydraulic regenerative braking system for vehicles. The system utilizes a reversible hydraulic unit that acts as a pump and motor as needed, converting mechanical energy to hydraulic energy during braking and vice versa during acceleration, thus recovering wasted energy. The use of this system leads to reduced power consumption and improved vehicle performance, a crucial solution in today's market with rising fuel prices and increasing environmental concerns.</p>

             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Engineering Research in Electrical and Electronic Engineering(IJEREEE) · Oct 1, 2016</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">The paper discusses the design and implementation of a secondary pressure drainer for a geothermal power plant. The system uses geothermal energy from the earth's crust to convert cold water into high-pressure steam. The high-temperature steam is combined with low-pressure steam to produce medium-pressure steam that is used as the motive fluid. The design uses renewable sources of energy, providing a sustainable and reliable solution for electricity generation.

Economical and Effective Method for Design and Fabrication of Pick and Place Robot</a>
             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) · Apr 30, 2016</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">This project proposes an economical and effective design for a pick and place robot. The robot consists of components such as a base box, mechanical arms, servo motors, and an arduino microcontroller. The structure is built using acrylic sheets for light weight and stability. The gripper is equipped with a pressure sensor to prevent dropping and breaking, and the movement is powered by servo motors. The advantage of this design is its economical cost, light weight, portability, and repeatability.</p>

Elimination of brake fade in vehicles by altering the brake disc size(A Concept) </a>
             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology · Nov 1, 2015</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">The paper focuses on the issue of brake fade, a reduction in stopping power caused by repeated or sustained application of brakes, and its consequences in high load or high speed conditions. To eliminate brake fade, it is necessary to keep the maximum temperature below the fade stop temperature. The paper analyzes the variables affecting the fade stop temperature and concludes that by minimizing the volume of the disc, the fade stop temperature is higher than the maximum temperature, thus making brake fade theoretically impossible. </p>
