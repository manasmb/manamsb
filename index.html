             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) · May 1, 2017</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">In the current scenario of rising fuel prices and increased environmental awareness, it has become essentially necessary for the vehicles to have a better fuel saving technology. To overcome this, advancement in automobile technology has given rise to Hybrid vehicles which has a promising and cleaner future. At present, many electric and hydraulic hybrid vehicles are available but none of them have a strong advantage over the conventional vehicles because of their inherent inefficiencies. The aim of this project is to create an improvised model of hydraulic regenerative braking system. The system consists of a reversible hydraulic unit which would act both as a pump and motor based on the requirement. The hydraulic fluid is pumped to high pressure accumulator which converts mechanical energy to hydraulic energy and vice-versa during the phases of braking and acceleration, thereby recovering the energy wasted during braking. The main advantages are reduced power consumption and improved performance.</p>

             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Engineering Research in Electrical and Electronic Engineering(IJEREEE) · Oct 1, 2016</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the earth. The geothermal energy of the
earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet. Geothermal power is cost-effective, reliable, renewable, and
environment friendly. Geothermal power does not involve fuels. Hence, in terms of fuel cost fluctuations it is quite beneficial.
However high costs are involved in setting up the plant. A geothermal heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground
anywhere in the world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The
thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. A secondary pressure drainer
is a device which collects a liquid and by alternately pressurizing and depressurizing it through a valve arrangement, discharges it
by using gas pressure as the operating source. A suitable mechanism with valves and sensors are used to collect and discharge the
liquid. Secondary pressure drainers are mainly used for collection and discharge of steam condensate. Initially, a pipeline is
inserted into the earth’s crust at a predetermined site suitable for geothermal plant. Cold water is passed through this pipeline and
as a result of the heat present inside the earth, the water is converted into high pressure and high temperature steam. The pipeline
is further connected to the inlet of a secondary pressure drainer, where the steam coming from the geothermal plant is the motive
fluid. Inside the pressure drainer, the high temperature, high pressure steam when combined with the low pressure steam, from the
extracted surface is directed to the condenser and as a result, the resultant outward flow is converted into a medium pressure
steam. The major advantage with this system is older systems of secondary pressure drainers involves heating up the motive fluid
by conventional energy sources but our design uses renewable sources of energy which are reliable and sustainable.

Economical and Effective Method for Design and Fabrication of Pick and Place Robot</a>
             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR) · Apr 30, 2016</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">In the modern world, Information and Technology has overtaken traditional practices for various objectives in the field of
Engineering and research. One of the significant inventions of this era is a robot. There are many different reasons for using a robot but
the central reason for most applications is to eliminate a human operator and reduce cost. Evolution of robots has led to a work specific
robot called as a pick and place robot. Basically, a pick and place robot is an electrically or mechanically driven mechanism attached to
and controlled by a gripper for loading and removing a part. This project proposes an economical and effective method for design and
fabrication of a pick and place robot. The design process begins by specifying top level of the manipulator’s structure to all subsequent
components by using acrylic sheets. By considering the mechanical arm’s performance objectives, the design starts with modelling the
integration of all individual links constituting the manipulator. During the design process, modifications are made based on integrated
information of kinematics, dynamics and structural analysis of the desired robot configuration as a whole. This involves components
such as base box, mechanical arms, servo motors and arduino microcontroller. The sole purpose of using acrylic sheets is that it is light
in weight and is stable. Grippers are used to pick and place the components and the movement is carried with the help of servo motors. It
has got built in pressure sensor which prevents dropping and breaking. The advantage of this robotic mechanism over existing models is
that it is economical, light weight and portable, also has repeatability within tolerance limits</p>

Elimination of brake fade in vehicles by altering the brake disc size(A Concept) </a>
             <p class="pubname">International Journal of Innovative Research in Science, Engineering and Technology · Nov 1, 2015</p>
             <p class="paperdesc">Brakes are one of the most important control components of the vehicle. They contribute very much in the
movement of the vehicle. . Brakes are generally applied to rotating axles or wheels. The momentum or kinetic energy to
stop the vehicle when in motion is converted to heat energy by the friction of brake pads and the rotors which is dissipated
into the surrounding air. The main functions of brakes are mainly to stop the vehicle in shortest possible time and to help
in controlling the speed of the vehicle. However, with long term use of brakes many problems occur which results in brake
failure, leading to a fatal injury caused to the driver and co-passengers. One of the most important causes of brake failure
are brake fades. Vehicle braking system fade, or brake fade, is the reduction in stopping power that can occur after
repeated or sustained application of the brakes, especially in high load or high speed conditions. For elimination of brake
fade, it is necessary for maximum temperature to be less than fade stop temperature. So, to have lesser temperature we
alter the parameters dependent on it. Since, stopping time, density of material, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity
and ambient temperature are constants, it is possible to alter heat flux. . If the value of fade stop temperature is higher than
maximum temperature , then fade doesn‟t occur. So for a higher fade temperature, we should have the volume of disc
minimum. Thus, in here we prove that fade stop temperature is higher than maximum temperature. So, theoretically
proving fade is not possible. Advantages- Low-fade brakes such as disc brakes in steered wheels can do more braking
without causing brake steer, Elimination of brake fading provides a larger leverage and mechanical advantage to resist the
turning of the rotor itself and It also provides a longer life time for the braking system, thus reducing the maintenance cost
of the vehicle.</p>

             <p class="paperdesc">Don't take your loved one’s security for granted. If you think you don't need a security system to protect
your loved ones, think again. Unfortunately, the facts about thefts and other security issues speak for themselves. In
recent years, burglaries have increased by 9.8% from 2006. By adopting our type of security system, we help in detection
of the burglar with our sophisticated method, wherein prevention of robbery is difficult (like in an ATM, where it is a
secluded and private location). Consider an environment in which prevention of burglary is literally impossible (for
example : an unoccupied house, an ATM, etc). The burglar entering such an isolated location would have a
communication device like a cell phone, etc. In the case of our type of security system, it involves placing a signal sensor
in a disguised location (for example: signal sensor placed in the camera of an ATM ). Since each cell phone has an
unique code, it emits unique radiations. This radiation will be recorded by the signal sensor placed within desired range.
This recorded signal will be sent to the telecommunication base wherein the identity of the burglar will be revealed.
Thus, enabling the law enforcement agencies to restore safety and security to citizens. Advantages of our type of security
system: Inexpensive, effective, has wide range of applications in private locations, no malfunctions.</p>

             <p class="paperdesc">Energy development is a field of endeavour
focused on making sufficient energy sources to meet the needs
of the society. One of the most significant contributor to
electricity generation is wind energy. Normally, windmills are
placed at higher altitudes, wherein wind starts blowing in
more than one direction due to climatic changes and seasons.
This decreases the efficiency of the windmills. For this, we
place pressure sensors on the nose cone of the windmill. These
pressure sensors detects several speeds of wind as well as
their direction and records them. This data is transferred to
the control box, wherein microcontroller is placed. This
microcontroller considers maximum wind speed condition.
This in turn stimulates mechanical action, wherein the U-
shaped clamp, placed on a roller bearing, which is connected
to the nose cone aligns itself perpendicular to the direction of
the wind.</p>
